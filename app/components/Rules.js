                <p>To start a new game, go on <a href="/newgame">Start Game</a> and enter your username and enter a name for the game. This starts a chat room where you can see who else is playing or who else wants to join the game. In order to start a game, you need at least six players and the person who is initiating the game (the game leader) must click on the Start Game button. Each game will have at least 1 Seer, 1 Doctor, and 2 werewolves, and the rest of the players will be Villagers. Each player should keep their role a secret from other players.</p>

              <div className="col-8">
                <p>The game proceeds in alternating night and day rounds. It begins with nighttime.</p>
              <h3> The Night</h3>
              <p> At night, the werewolves chat with one another and choose one villager to kill. Each werewolf will vote for their victim by typing "/vote VictimName". The werewolves must unanimously agree on a single victim. There will be a limit on how long they can deliberate.</p><br />

              <p>Next, the Doctor selects someone they'd like to protect. The person chosen (which could be the Doctor himself) will survive if the werewolves had chosen to kill them. If a player gets selected by the werewolves, and then saved by the Doctor, the moderator will let the village know by announcing the news at the beginning of daytime.</p><br />

              <p>At the same time, the Seer can ask if a particular player is a werewolf, and the moderator will answer.</p><br/>

              <h3>The Day</h3>
              <p>At the beginning of each day, the moderator announces the username of the player who has been killed, or that nobody died that night. That person is out of the game. They do not reveal their role.</p><br/>

              <p>All the living players in the village chat with one another and try to figure out which of their fellow villagers is a werewolf in disguise - and then lynch that player. There are no restrictions on speech. Any living player can say anything they want -- truth, misdirection, nonsense, or a barefaced lie. Dead players may not speak at all. Similarly, as soon as a majority of players decide on whom to lynch, that player is dead and out of the game. If an accused party wants to protest, they must do so before the vote goes through. Once a player is lynched, night falls and the cycle repeats. </p>
